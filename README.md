Steps to run the quiz:

1. Clone repository locally or download zip.
2. Access go-quiz-api directory and either run the go-quiz-api executable or run "go run main.go" through a terminal to initialize the API component.
3. Access go-quiz-cli directory and either run the go-quiz-cli executable or open a separate terminal, access go-quiz-cli directory and run "go run main.go quiz" to start the quiz.

Note: It is important to run the API component first to allow the CLI to retrieve the quiz questions.
